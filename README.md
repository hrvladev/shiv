Shiv is a Scheme interpreter written in Python which implements a subset of the [standard R5RS Scheme](http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs.pdf).

It's created as a self-educational, hobby project for the [Python course](http://2016.fmi.py-bg.net/) in the [Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (FMI), Sofia University “St. Kliment Ohridski”](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en/).
